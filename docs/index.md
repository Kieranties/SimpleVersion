Brief
-----

SimpleVersion aims to simplify how you version the artifacts of your git repository.

Using SimpleVersion you can generate consistent, expected version numbers for
each commit in your repository, based on a few simple configuration options.

SimpleVersion uses some base configuration and the 'height' of your commit history
to generate a version.  Height is calculated as the number of commits since your
last change to the version.

Future versions of SimpleVersion aim to provide:
+ Validation of the version based on branch configuration
+ Custom formatting configuration to support custom versioning schemes
+ and more!

Why?
----

SimpleVersion borrows ideas from other excellent versioning tools, notably:
[GitVersion] and [NerdBank.GitVersioning][NerdBank]. These tools also deliver
the ability to version your repository based on the commits but work in a
different manner:
+ GitVersion relies heavily on branch names, merge messages and more. I have found this
can sometimes cause issues without extreme management of best practices.
+ Nerdbank is an excellent tool that removes many of the issues I ran into with
GitVersion, however is more limited in scope for custom labelling formats.

Usage
-----

To use SimpleVersion, you simply need to add a `.simpleversion.json` file to the
root of your git repository and commit it.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "label": [ "alpha2" ],
  "branches": {
    "release": [
      "^refs/heads/master$",
      "^refs/heads/preview/.+$",
      "^refs/heads/release/.+$"
    ]
  }
}
```
The above configuration tells SimpleVersion that the version will be `0.1.0` and
should have a release label of `alpha2`.  As their is a pre-release label, the
height will be appended to label, generating a [Semver2] version `0.1.0-alpha2.3`
if their were three commits since the version was last set.

For further guidance, see the [configuration documentation][ConfigDoc] and the [usage documentation][UsageDoc].

Resetting The Height
--------------------

The height will be reset to 0 when SimpleVersion detects a change to either the
`version` or the `label` in the `.simpleversion.json` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must commit changes to the file for SimpleVersion to identify the change
