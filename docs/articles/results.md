Results
=======

How you handle the results of SimpleVersion will vary based on how you are
invoking the tool.  However, all implementations return the same results object.

The following is an example from invoking the command line tool:

```json
{
  "Version": "0.1.0",
  "Major": 0,
  "Minor": 1,
  "Patch": 0,
  "Revision": 0,
  "Height": 18,
  "HeightPadded": "0018",
  "Sha": "ebc8f22ae83bfa3c1e36d6bf70c2a383ae30c9dd",
  "Sha7": "ebc8f22",
  "CanonicalBranchName": "refs/heads/preview/test",
  "BranchName": "preview/test",
  "Formats": {
    "Semver1": "0.1.0-alpha2-0018",
    "Semver2": "0.1.0-alpha2.18"
  }
}
```
